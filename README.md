# 7z SFX Builder (Deprecated)

You can find compiled version at [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/s-zipsfxbuilder/)  

### Short description
This software is designed to create and manage 7zip SFX configuration files for modified SFX module by Oleg Scherbakov, which is not in active development now (and probably won't ever be). So, I think this project has nothing to do anymore. It covers almost every command that modified module supports. Source code is a whole mess, because it was written when I was making first steps into programming. Although, you may find some interesting things there :)

### Warning !
This software isn't tested to work with newer versions of [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/), use at your own risk.
